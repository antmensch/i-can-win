We were at the table by the window with the view
Casting shadows, the sun was pushing through
Spoke a lot of words, I don't know if I spoke the truth
Got so much to lose
Got so much to prove
God, don't let me lose my mind
Trouble on my left, trouble on my right
I've been facing trouble almost all my life
My sweet love, won't you pull me through?
Everywhere I look, I catch a glimpse of you
I said it was love and I did it for life
I didn't do it for you
